                <h1>Special consent to telehealth services</h1>
                <p>Telemedicine involves the delivery of health care services using electronic communications, information technology, or other means between a health care provider and a patient who are not in the same physical location. Telemedicine may be used for diagnosis, treatment, follow-up and/or related patient education, and may include, but is not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Electronic transmission of medical records, photo images, personal health information, or other data between a patient and health care provider;</li>
                    <li>Interactions between a patient and health care provider via audio, video, and/or data communications; and</li>

                <p>The electronic systems used in the Services will incorporate network and software security protocols to protect the privacy and security of health information and imaging data, and will include measures to safeguard the data to ensure its integrity against intentional or unintentional corruption.
                    Please see our Consent to Telehealth available for a description of the risks and benefits of telemedicine. The Consent to Telehealth is hereby incorporated into these Terms of Use by reference and constitutes a part of these Terms of Use.
                </p>
                <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
                <p>Vital Protocol understands the importance of confidentiality and privacy regarding your health information. Please see: (1) our Privacy Policy available on the Sites vitalprotocol.com for a description of how we may collect and use your personal information, and (2) the Vital Protocol Professionals Notice of Privacy Practices applicable to OpenLoop Health LLC and similar affiliated professional entities for a description of how these entities may use and disclose your medical information and how you may access that information. The Privacy Policy and Vital Protocol Professionals Notice of Privacy Practices are hereby incorporated into these Terms of Use by reference and constitute a part of these Terms of Use.</p>
                <h1>Your relationship with Vital Protocol</h1>
                <p>Vital Protocol does not provide any medical services, including via the Sites and Services. Rather, Vital Protocol provides a technology platform for you to access a health care provider employed or contracted with OpenLoop Health LLC or similar affiliated professional entities and obtain access to additional information, which you may or may not choose to utilize in planning your health care and wellness. The health and wellness resources made available through our Services are not a substitute for direct in-person health care services in all cases. The decision to focus on diagnosis, treatment recommendations, or both, rests with you and the health care provider. You understand that by coordinating and in certain cases consulting with an OpenLoop Health LLC or affiliate health care provider through the Services, you are not entering into a provider-patient relationship with Vital Protocol
                    By accepting the Terms of Use, you agree and consent to Vital Protocol, Vital Protocol affiliates, or health care providers sending you disclosures, notices, messages, reports, and other communications. It is your responsibility to monitor these communications. You acknowledge and agree that you will not hold us or any Vital Protocol affiliate liable for any loss, injury, or claim of any kind resulting from your failure to read these communications or for your failure to comply with any treatment recommendations contained in these communications.
                </p>
                <h1>Communications by text message and email</h1>
                <p>By opting-in to receive text (SMS) messages from Vital Protocol or by sending Vital Protocol an initial text message (an "SMS Enrollment"), you consent to receiving text messages regarding your Vital Protocol account and use of the Sites and Services. These text messages may include order confirmations, shipping notifications, messages from your healthcare provider, and other transactional messages, as well as promotional and marketing notifications, to the extent you have opted-in to receive such messages from Vital Protocol.</p>
                <p>With your SMS Enrollment, you represent and understand that: (1) you are the owner or authorized user of the mobile device you used in order to initiate the SMS Enrollment, (2) you are authorized to approve any applicable charges in connection with the text messages you send to and receive from Vital Protocol, (3) you will be responsible for all messaging and other data charges that may apply for any text messages sent to you from Vital Protocol, or from Vital Protocol to you, and (4) neither Vital Protocol, nor your or Vital Protocol's mobile carriers, will be liable for delayed or undelivered messages.</p>
                <p>Note that access to the Services and the Sites is not conditioned upon your consent to receive marketing or promotional text messages from Vital Protocol, and you can opt-out of any of Vital Protocol's SMS services at any time by texting "STOP" to the message received, from the mobile device that is subscribed to receive the SMS messages. After you send the text message "STOP" to us, we may send you one final text message to confirm that you have been unsubscribed. If you have opted-in to receive more than one type of text message from Vital Protocol, you will need to opt-out of each Vital Protocol SMS service to which you are subscribed. Until you have done so, you may continue to receive the types of text messages from Vital Protocol that you have opted-in to receive but have not unsubscribed from.</p>
                <p>You also understand that while Vital Protocol takes your privacy and the security of your health and other sensitive information very seriously, the transmission of information over the internet and mobile networks is not 100% secure. Text messages and emails that you send to or receive from Vital Protocol are not encrypted, which means that it is possible they may be intercepted by third parties. If you choose to send or receive information about your health or any other sensitive information by text message or email, you do so at your own risk. By initiating an SMS Enrollment, you consent to sending text messages to Vital Protocol, and receiving text messages from Vital Protocol, that are not encrypted. Likewise, by emailing Vital Protocol or giving Vital Protocol your email, you consent to receiving unencrypted emails messages from Vital Protocol.</p>
                <p>If you are experiencing any issues with Vital Protocol's text messaging or email services, or if you have any concerns about sending or receiving any sensitive information through text or email, please contact us directly at support@vitalprotocol.com. If you have questions specific to your text or data plan, please contact your wireless provider.</p>

                <h1>Consultation services</h1>
                <p>In some cases, an OpenLoop Health LLC or affiliated health care provider may use the Services to provide advice or treatment to you. A health care provider consulting with you through the Services may not have the benefit of information that would be obtained by examining you in person and observing your physical condition, in each instance. Therefore, the health care provider may not be aware of facts or information that may affect his or her opinion regarding a potential diagnosis or treatment recommendation. To reduce the risk to you of this limitation, Vital Protocol strongly encourages you to provide all relevant information and discuss any and all diagnosis and treatment options with a health care provider. Moreover, a health care provider utilizing Vital Protocol may be limited by state law in prescribing certain medications to you without first conducting an in-person physical examination. By deciding to engage the Services, you acknowledge and agree that you are aware of these limitations and agree to assume the risk of these limitations. Furthermore, you agree and accept that: (i) any diagnosis you may receive is limited and, in some cases, provisional; (ii) the health care services are not intended, in all cases, to replace a full medical evaluation or an in-person visit with a health care provider; (iii) a health care provider acting through the Services may not have important information that is usually obtained through a "hands-on" physical examination; and (iv) the absence of a physical examination may affect the health care provider's ability to diagnose any potential condition, disease or injury.
                </p>
                <p>For more information regarding the health care services offered by health care providers utilizing the Services, please visit vitalprotocol.com.</p>

                <h1>Registration and user accounts</h1>
                <p>Although certain parts of the Sites are accessible by any individual, you are obligated to register with Vital Protocol in order to access the Services. The Services are available only to users who have registered with Vital Protocol and to other persons affiliated with Vital Protocol who have been granted accounts with usernames and passwords ("Secure Users"). If you are a Secure User, you agree to provide information that is accurate, complete and correct, and to accurately maintain and update any information about yourself that you have provided to Vital Protocol. If you do not maintain such information, or Vital Protocol has reasonable grounds to suspect as much, Vital Protocol has the right to suspend or terminate your account and your use of the Services. You also agree to immediately notify Vital Protocol of any unauthorized use of your username, password or any other breach of security that you become aware of involving or relating to the Services by emailing Vital Protocol at support@vitalprotocol.com. Vital Protocol may take any and all actions it deems necessary or reasonable to maintain the security of the Sites, Services and your Secure User account.
                </p>
                <p>You agree to keep confidential your username and password and to exit from your Secure User account at the end of each session. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account and for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. You are responsible for changing your password promptly if you think it has been compromised. You may not transfer or share your password with anyone, or create more than one account. You may not use anyone else's account at any time. Vital Protocol explicitly disclaims liability for any and all losses and damages arising from your failure to comply with this section. You acknowledge and agree that: (1) all or any part of the Sites may not be accessible at any time, for any period, or for any reason; and (2) Vital Protocol will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Sites are unavailable at any time or for any period</p>
                <h1>"jailbreaking" the operating system</h1>
                <p>The App is intended for use only on a mobile phone that runs an unmodified manufacturer approved operating system. Using the App on a mobile phone with a modified operating system may undermine security features that are intended to protect your protected health information from unauthorized or unintended disclosure. As a result, you may compromise your protected health information if you use the App on a mobile phone that has been modified. Use of the App on a mobile phone with a modified operating system is a material breach of these Terms of Use.</p>

                <h1>Access rights and prohibited uses</h1>

                <h1>Packaging and fulfillment restrictions</h1>
                <p>If you select to use the Vital Protocol Pharmacy Network to fulfil any prescriptions provided by health care providers through the Services, you acknowledge that your medication, if approved, will not be shipped in child-resistant packaging and that you must keep it out of the reach of children.</p>

                <h1>Payment</h1>
                <p>You agree to pay all fees due for services requested. You will see a prompt for your payment details, such as your credit card information and any promotional codes you may have. By entering your payment information and submitting your request, you authorize us, our affiliates, or our third-party payment processors to charge the amount due.</p>

                <p>You understand and agree that you are responsible for all fees due to receive health care services and pharmacy services, including any fees charged by the health care organization(s) or provider(s). Your payments to Vital Protocol may include fees charged by health care organization(s) or provider(s) for health care services and/or pharmacy services, which Vital Protocol collects on their behalf. Any health care services or pharmacy services not made available through the Services are not included in the payments collected by Vital Protocol and you may be separately charged by the applicable health care providers for such services. In the event that your credit card expires or Vital Protocol, our affiliates, or our third-party payment processors are unable to process your payment, you may receive notice for you to provide an alternative payment method. Vital Protocol and/or the health care organization(s) and/or provider(s) have no obligation to provide any health care services or pharmacy services unless and until full payment has been received and/or verified.</p>

                <h1>Special notice to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries</h1>
                <p>Federal and state health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, do not pay for all health care costs, even for some health care services and products that you or your health care provider have good reason to think you need. If you are a beneficiary of a federal or state health care program, and such program does not pay for certain services or products rendered to you, you may have to pay for these services and products. As we understand it, neither federal nor state health care programs currently pay for any of the medical services or products made available through the Services performed by affiliated health care organizations or providers, at least not in the way such services or products are provided (i.e., using telemedicine and bundled treatment offerings). By agreeing to use the Services, you acknowledge and agree that: (1) you will pay directly for any medical services and products provided to you, and (2) neither Vital Protocol nor any Vital Protocol affiliated health care organization or provider will bill any federal or state health care program for such medical services or products.</p>

                <h1>Testosterone health program terms and conditions</h1>
                <p>This section describes additional terms and conditions applicable to your participation in the Testosterone Health Program (the "Program") offered through Vital Protocol and the affiliated professional entities that provide services on the Vital Protocol platform. The Program is designed to provide access to routine and necessary services for the management of low testosterone in biological males caused by secondary hypogonadism. The Program is a membership-based service through which eligible Members can obtain limited medical care, including at-home phlebotomy services, medication at the discretion of the Member's provider, and pharmacy services for a recurring monthly payment. The Program is not health insurance or a substitute for health insurance, does not meet any individual health insurance mandate under federal or state law, and cannot replace your in-person provider relationships. You should keep your existing health insurance coverage while you are participating in the Program or obtain health insurance coverage if you do not currently have it.</p>

                <h1>Eligibility limitations applicable to the Program</h1>
                <p>Except in New York, Florida, and Illinois, in order to be eligible to participate in the program you must have a commercial health insurance benefits plan, including, but not limited to, an employer-provided health insurance plan, that may be billed for laboratory services. To learn more about billing for laboratory services please see the "Laboratory testing services not included" section below. You understand and agree that the affiliated professional entities, the healthcare professionals practicing on the Immuto Inc., D/B/D Tellescope platform, and the pharmacies in the Vital Protocol Pharmacy Network will not bill your health insurance benefits plan for the health care and pharmacy services and products that you receive as part of the Program and that such health care and pharmacy services and products may not be eligible for reimbursement. You understand and agree that you are responsible for all fees due to receive health care and pharmacy services and products consistent with the "Payment" and "Special notice to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries" sections above.</p>

                <h1>Onboarding and diagnosis</h1>
                <p>In order to participate in the Program, you must be evaluated by a doctor or nurse practitioner on the Vital Protocol platform and, in the professional judgment of such health care provider, meet the clinical criteria for participation. To be evaluated for participation, you must complete an initial onboarding telehealth medical assessment (the "Diagnosis Online Visit") with a doctor or nurse practitioner and obtain laboratory blood testing to measure your key physiological indicators including, but not limited to, your serum testosterone levels. If, following a review of the laboratory results and the Diagnosis Online Visit, your health care provider determines that you are a good candidate for treatment through the Program, he or she may initiate such treatment by writing you a prescription.</p>
                <p>You acknowledge and agree that, even if you do not meet the clinical criteria for participation in the Program, you are responsible for payment of the cost of the Diagnosis Online Visit and any laboratory testing that your health care provider orders for you and such cost is not included in the Membership Fee.</p>

                <h1>Membership and Additional Services</h1>
                <p>Your membership ("Membership") in the Program, including your ability to access the Membership Services and your obligation to pay Membership Fees (each as defined below) will commence when your health care provider communicates your care plan, risks and benefits of treatment, and you acknowledge such and elect to proceed with participation in the Program.</p>

                <p>You will have an opportunity to review and agree to the cost of Membership (the "Membership Fee") during the checkout process that is part of the Diagnosis Online Visit. You may also view the costs associated with Membership on the Program webpage located here. Once you begin participation in the Program, your Membership Fee will be automatically charged to your payment card or PayPal account on file on a recurring, monthly, quarterly, or annual basis (depending on the billing plan you have selected) until your Membership is canceled. The initial payment must be made the day your Membership commences. Once paid, your Membership Fee is non-refundable. You may cancel your Membership at any time by calling us at (908) 280-5268, emailing us at support@vitalprotocol.com, or logging into your Secure User account.</p>

                <p>If you choose to have your prescription filled at a local pharmacy, your Membership Fee will not include the cost of medication and pharmacy fulfillment. If you transfer your prescription from a local pharmacy to the Vital Protocol Pharmacy Network, the cost of medication and pharmacy fulfillment will be added to your Membership Fee at the beginning of the next billing cycle. You may transfer your prescription to a local pharmacy or to the Vital Protocol Pharmacy Network at any time by calling us at (908) 280-5268 or emailing us at support@vitalprotocol.com.</p>

                <h1>Canceling your Membership</h1>
                <p>You may cancel your Membership at any time by calling us at (908) 280-5268, emailing us at support@vitalprotocol.com, or logging into your Secure User account. Any Membership Fees paid prior to the date of cancellation are non-refundable.</p>

                <h1>Delaying your Membership</h1>
                <p>If you would like to delay your billing date for any reason, you may delay by logging into your Secure User account, calling us at  (908) 280-5268, or emailing us at support@vitalprotocol.com. You may learn more about how to initiate a delay through your Secure User account in the FAQs located here. When you delay, you will not be charged a Membership Fee until the end of the delay period that you have selected. During such period, you will not be eligible to receive any Membership Services, except you may still message your Vital Protocol-affiliated health care professional through Vital Protocol's secure messaging application at any time. Delaying could impact your ability to adhere to your treatment plan. As a result, at your Vital Protocol-affiliated health care provider's discretion, you may need to be re-evaluated and undergo additional laboratory testing before continuing with treatment (a "Continuation Visit") at the end of a delay period. If you delay for a cumulative period of eight (8) consecutive weeks or more without scheduling a Continuation Visit, your Membership may be canceled without notice.</p>

                <h1>Pausing your Membership</h1>
                <p>If you would like to pause your Membership by turning off auto-payments (going "On-demand") for any reason, you may do so by logging into your Secure User account, calling us at  (908) 280-5268, or emailing us at support@vitalprotocol.com. You may learn more about how to go On-demand through your Secure User account in the FAQs located here. When you go On-demand, you will not be charged any additional monthly Membership Fee payments until you initiate a charge by ordering a refill of your medication or turning auto-payments back on. You will receive Membership Services through the last day of the monthly billing cycle for which you have paid the monthly Membership Fee. Thereafter, other than messaging your Vital Protocol-affiliated health care professional through Vital Protocol's secure messaging application, you will not be eligible to receive any Membership Services until you initiate another charge as described above. Going On-demand could impact your ability to adhere to your treatment plan. As a result, at your Vital Protocol-affiliated health care provider's discretion, you may need to undergo a Continuation Visit before continuing with treatment at the end of an On-demand period. If you remain On-demand for a cumulative period of eight (8) consecutive weeks or more without scheduling a Continuation Visit, your Membership may be canceled without notice.</p>

                <h1>No representation, warranty, or guarantee of continued availability of the Program</h1>
                <p>NEITHER VITAL PROTOCOL NOR THE AFFILIATED PROFESSIONAL ENTITIES MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR GUARANTEES REGARDING THE CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THE PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM MAY BE DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME AT THE SOLE DISCRETION OF VITAL PROTOCOL AND/OR THE AFFILIATED PROFESSIONAL ENTITIES. YOU WILL BE GIVEN 30 DAYS' NOTICE OF ANY SUCH DISCONTINUATION SO THAT YOU MAY FIND A LOCAL PROVIDER WITH WHOM TO CONTINUE TREATMENT.</p>

OpenLoop Health LLC allows you to receive treatment from a healthcare practitioner without having to travel to another location or schedule a separate appointment and helps you avoid long wait times that you might otherwise experience at an in-person visit. What is Asynchronous Telemedicine? Asynchronous telemedicine is one way to deliver telemedicine. Asynchronous communication is often referred to as "store-and-forward" communication, where participants submit and collect data at different times. An example of asynchronous communication is a telemedicine encounter with a healthcare practitioner that involves sending photos, video, or other communications via email or text message. "Asynchronous" means "not occurring at the same time" and is different from "synchronous" telemedicine, which generally includes visits conducted in real-time between patients and healthcare practitioners through audio or video means (e.g., live phone calls or video-conferencing). Healthcare practitioners may use asynchronous telemedicine to aid in diagnoses and medical consultations when live communication or face-to-face contact is not possible or necessary. OpenLoop Health LLC's platform (Platform), in particular, allows for the following asynchronous telemedicine services: 1) text-based healthcare practitioner-patient interactions through short message service (SMS) and multimedia messaging service (MMS) communications; and 2) secure information collection through asynchronous store-and-forward patient questionnaires. What are the Possible Risks to Using Asynchronous Telemedicine? As with any medical treatment, there are potential risks associated with the use of asynchronous telemedicine. OpenLoop Health LLC believes that the likelihood of these risks materializing is very low. These risks may include, without limitation, the following: • Delays in medical evaluation and consultation or treatment may occur due to deficiencies or failures of the equipment or the Internet, which may include poor data quality, Internet outages, or other service interruption issues. You may reschedule the visit with your healthcare practitioner should these interruptions occur. • Security protocols could fail, causing a breach of privacy of personal medical information. • Because OpenLoop Health LLC does not have access to your complete medical records, if you do not disclose to your healthcare practitioner a full list of your medical history including diagnoses, treatments, medications/supplements, and allergies, adverse treatment, drug interactions or allergic reactions, or other negative outcomes may occur. • Asynchronous telemedicine services are NOT emergency services and your Personal Data (as defined in the OpenLoop Health LLC Privacy Policy) WILL NOT BE MONITORED 24/7. If you think you are experiencing a medical emergency, CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY. THE CARE YOU RECEIVE WILL BE AT THE SOLE DISCRETION OF THE HEALTHCARE PRACTITIONER WHO IS TREATING YOU, WITH NO GUARANTEE OF DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT, OR PRESCRIPTION. THE HEALTHCARE PRACTITIONER WILL DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE CONDITION BEING DIAGNOSED AND/OR TREATED IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE CARE PROVIDED THROUGH AN ASYNCHRONOUS TELEMEDICINE ENCOUNTER VIA THE PLATFORM</p>
